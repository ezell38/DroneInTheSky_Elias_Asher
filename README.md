### Primary goal then following iterations 

Primary Goal - 

Use a Pico to track a drone and display its path on a phone screen. Have a IR remote attached to the drone remote that controls when the PICO is drawing on the phone screen and when it isn't.  

Iterations - 

 - Adding a button onto the IR remote that when pressed prompts the drone to fly in a square and map it out
 
 - Adding a button onto the IR remote that when pressed prompts the drone to fly in a circle and map it out
 
 - Adding a button onto the IR remote that when pressed prompts the drone to fly in a star and map it out

### What we need to learn

 - How to add bluetooth to a pico
 
 - How to track distance using a pico 


### Schedule

Weeks 1 and 2: We will complete the planning document besides code and cad sketches, schedule, and get permission.
Week 3: We will complete pseudocode and CAD sketches of each part, and purchase/collect supplies.
Weeks 4 and 5: We will start drafting the real code and CAD for printing, as well as wiring.
Week 6: Complete process of connecting Pico to phone application and figure out display method.
Week 7: Combine all components into full project for testing.
Week 8: First Prototype test of flight, just tracking location and mapping.
Week 9 and 10: Fix issues with code/flight
