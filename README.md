### Primary goal then following iterations 

Primary Goal - 

Use a Pico to track a drone and display its path on a phone screen. Have a IR remote attached to the drone remote that controls when the PICO is drawing on the phone screen and when it isn't.  

Iterations - 
 1 - Adding a button onto the IR remote that when pressed prompts the drone to fly in a square and map it out
 2 - Adding a button onto the IR remote that when pressed prompts the drone to fly in a circle and map it out
